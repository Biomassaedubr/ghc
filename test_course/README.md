This is some more text or a picture or something ignored.

## Summary

`Summary` is a special section summarizing the course in a way that
can be saved in the `course.json` file under the `summary` key.
Avoid any links that are not fully qualified URLs. No images and
such. Put that stuff above or below the summary if wanted.

## TOC Explanation

The following `Table of Contents` section will always be updated
from the data in the course file and directory organization. Concepts
will be summarized in a list under each section title. **Any
changes made to it will be discarded and replaced with the derived
TOC**. If it is not found nothing is done.

## Table of Contents

This text will be lost and replaced.

## A Header That is Not Used

This is a section that won't be included in anything else.
These allow the main `README.md` file to contain information
that might not be directly related to the course.

## Warnings

You might want to include a section somewhere that explains that this
course material is managed with the `ghc` app and a reference to the
docs on how to do thatâ€”mostly for those who are not aware and wanting
to edit or fork it.
